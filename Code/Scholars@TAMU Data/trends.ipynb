       "'<jats:p>One major characteristic of studies in operations and supply chain                         management literature is a focus on how integration can lead to superior                         operations and manufacturing outcomes. Most of these studies, however, focus                         only on internal or external integration and few have been dedicated to                         understand how both internal and external integration influence performance                         outcomes. In addition, few studies, if any, have looked to the antecedents                         of organizational structure as a driver for such forms of integration. To                         help filling this gap, we draw on organizational structure and                         resource-based view theoretical perspectives to present a conceptual model                         that proposes a relationship between organizational structure and                         integration. The model also considers major antecedents of organizational                         structure and the manufacturing performance consequences of integration. As                         a result, we introduce a series of propositions to be subject to empirical                         scrutiny as well as serve as a reference for future conceptual and empirical                         models.</jats:p>'"
